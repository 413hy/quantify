# AI Quant System implementation

This is the isolated implementation repository for the AI quantitative trading system. The immutable requirements and strategy references remain outside this repository under `/root/quantify/reference-materials/`.

Current state: the offline Paper development path and core Binance Testnet protocol flow are
implemented and verified. ADR 0005 endpoints, authenticated capability checks, actual
place/query/cancel, native Algo protection within 1,000ms, reduce-only flatten and final zero-state
reconciliation pass. The external encrypted archive roundtrip, signed decryption receipt and
isolated restore probe also pass; its formal 90-day capacity gate is pending added storage.
Time-based Shadow/calibration/live gates remain pending. No production
credential has been requested, copied, or injected; runtime remains `RISK_LOCKED` and is not
authorized for live trading.

See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md), [HANDOFF_STATE.md](HANDOFF_STATE.md), and [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-implementation-baseline.md).
